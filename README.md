This project has been on my to-do list for quite some time, and I've finally decided to start it. The primary goal is to create a lightweight solution for synchronizing and backing up files and folders with a simple JSON-based configuration.

### Planned Key Features:
* __File and Folder Synchronization__: Seamlessly synchronize files and directories across different locations or devices.
* __Automated Backups__: Easily configure automated backups for important files and directories.
* __Simple Configuration__: Utilize a straightforward JSON file to define synchronization rules, backup schedules, and exclusions.
* __Cross-Platform Support__: Designed with cross-platform compatibility in mind (Windows, Linux, macOS).
* __Efficient and Lightweight__: Minimal resource consumption, focusing on performance and simplicity.

### Far Future Plans:
* __Real-time Synchronization__: Implement real-time file monitoring for immediate sync upon changes.
* __Cloud Integration__: Add support for cloud storage services like AWS S3, Google Drive, and Dropbox.
* __Notification System__: Provide notifications upon successful syncs or errors.
